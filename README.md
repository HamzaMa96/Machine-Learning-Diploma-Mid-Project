# Introduction:
The issue of Climate Change is threating the existence of all humanity, it includes rising sea levels, ecosystem collapse and more frequent and severe weather. Rising temperatures from human-caused greenhouse gas emissions affects planet-wide systems causing drought and severe heat.<br>
Due to the recent climate change which caused severe droughts and higher temperatures it is now harder for farmers to know what kind of weather to expect to determine which crops to grow to maximize revenue and efficiency<br>
The ability to predict whether it will rain and the quantity of the rain, to help farmers make decisions on the best crop to grow, to maximize profit, efficiency and reduce food shortages
# Features:
<ul>
<li>Date: The date of observation.</li>
<li>Location: The common name of the location of the weather station.</li>
<li>MinTemp: The minimum temperature in degrees Celsius.</li>
<li>MinTemp: The minimum temperature in degrees Celsius.</li>
<li>MaxTemp: The maximum temperature in degrees Celsius.</li>
<li>Rainfall: The amount of rainfall recorded for the day in mm.</li>
<li>Evaporation: The so-called Class A pan evaporation (mm) in the 24 hours to 9am.</li>
<li>Sunshine: The number of hours of bright sunshine in the day.</li>
<li>WindGustDir: The direction of the strongest wind gust in the 24 hours to midnight.</li>
<li>WindGustSpeed: The speed (km/h) of the strongest wind gust in the 24 hours to midnight.</li>
<li>WindDir9am: Direction of the wind at 9am.</li>
<li>WindDir3pm: Direction of the wind at 3pm.</li>
<li>WindSpeed9am: Wind speed (km/hr) averaged over 10 minutes prior to 9am.</li>
<li>WindSpeed3pm: Wind speed (km/hr) averaged over 10 minutes prior to 3pm.</li>
<li>Humidity9am: Humidity (percent) at 9am.</li>

<li>Pressure3pm: Atmospheric pressure (hpa) reduced to mean sea level at 3pm.</li>
<li>Cloud9am: Fraction of sky obscured by cloud at 9am. This is measured in "oktas", which are a unit of eigths.</li>
<li>Cloud3pm: Fraction of sky obscured by cloud (in "oktas": eighths) at 3pm.</li>
<li>Temp9am: Temperature (degrees C) at 9am.</li>
<li>Temp3pm: Temperature (degrees C) at 3pm.</li>
<li>RainToday: Boolean: 1 if precipitation (mm) in the 24 hours to 9am exceeds 1mm, otherwise 0.</li>
<li>RainTomorrow: The amount of next day rain in mm. Used to create response variable RainTomorrow. A kind of measure of the "risk".</li>
